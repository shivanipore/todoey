# todoey

A To-do-List project.

## Getting Started

This app is made using Flutter.
It uses the provider package for:
- simplified allocation/disposal of resources
- lazy-loading
- a largely reduced boilerplate over making a new class every time
- devtools friendly
- a common way to consume these InheritedWidgets (See Provider.of/Consumer/Selector)
- increased scalability for classes with a listening mechanism that grows exponentially in complexity (such as ChangeNotifier, which is O(NÂ²) for dispatching notifications).
